Place the tatuajes image here as `tatuajes.jpg`.

To use the image provided in the editor attachments, save that image to:

  src/assets/tatuajes.jpg

Recommended size: ~1200x720 (the app will resize to fit the card). If you prefer a different filename, update the import in `src/Productos.jsx` accordingly:

  import tatuajesImg from './assets/your-file-name.jpg'

Moda image (how to add)
-----------------------
To use the moda photo you uploaded, save it to the `public/assets` folder as `moda.jpg`:

  public/assets/moda.jpg

If `public/assets/moda.jpg` exists, the `Moda` card will load it automatically via `/assets/moda.jpg`.

Recommended size: ~1200x720.
